Todo:
    In geometry implement a class that S extends and that extends every possibler class that S can be for the geometry

    Rearchitect subsytems to better work with auton and state machine
        Combine Elevator and Wrist into "Superstructure" class to handle both
        Combine Climber and ClimberPuller into one ClimbSystemClass
            Figure out how to automate the climb sequence

    Create a way to run auto routines
        IE. Make is so we can define a list of actions to be done in sequence with some being done in parallel and some being done in series to write and auton

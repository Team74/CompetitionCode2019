Todo:
    In StateTracker, write the foward kinematics to keep track of our position using encoder and gyro feedback aka Localization.
        -https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/most-accurate-form-of-localization/166379/4

    Trajectory generator needs to poses defined as well as a fixed cordinate system.

    Also need to finish writing the trajectory generation code.

    Create pathfollower.
        -Look into Nonlinear feedback controller from the paper.
            https://www.dis.uniroma1.it/~labrob/pub/papers/Ramsete01.pdf
        -Implement pure pursuit.
        -implement standard feedword and feedback.
            -This might be useful for vision based panel/cargo placement.

    Rearchitect subsytems to better work with auton and state machine.
        -Combine Elevator and Wrist and Intake  into "Superstructure" class to handle both.
        -Combine Climber and ClimberPuller into one ClimbSystemClass or something similar.
            -Figure out how to automate the climb sequence.
        -Figure out how to test the subsystems; also possibly simulate them in code?

    Rearchitect swerve code to better work with pose tracking and path following, also to be cleaner in general.

    Instead of subsytemManager containing the continuosly updating classes, maybe make another class that we can store them in? Not sure if this is worth it.

    Work on creating the action components of autons.

    Make sure intake motors are assigned properly in the BallIntake class.

    Go through Constants.java and make sure everything is defined properly and the same way.

    Characterize swerve drive and store the data iun the appropriate places.

    Finish writing TimingUtil class.

    Figure out a way t test to make sure tht the trajectory generation works.

    Look into setting up vision tracking.

    Look here https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/potential-engine-a-simple-rtsp-server-for-frc-or-anywhere-else/348935/15
        for a possible better robot to driver station video streaming solution.

    Figure out a way to log events and data from the robot for post match viewing.
        -Figure out a system for where to put prints/logs in autonomous and what we should print/log in auto code.
